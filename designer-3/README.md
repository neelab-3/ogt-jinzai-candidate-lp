---

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

This landing page embodies a **dynamic, visual-first approach** with **immersive storytelling** through impactful imagery and parallax effects. The design creates a premium, cinematic experience that conveys the prestige and professionalism of OGT! 人才's executive search services.

### Key Design Principles

1. **Visual Impact First** - Large, full-screen imagery with dramatic overlays
2. **Parallax Depth** - Multi-layer scrolling effects create depth and engagement
3. **Cinematic Experience** - Video-like presentation with scroll-triggered animations
4. **Premium Feel** - High-quality visuals paired with sophisticated typography
5. **Immersive Storytelling** - Each section unfolds like chapters in a story

## 🎯 Design Decisions

### Color Palette

```css
Primary Navy:   #1a2332 (Main background, text)
Dark Navy:      #0f1419 (Footer, deep sections)
Charcoal:       #2c3e50 (Secondary backgrounds)
Gold Accent:    #c9a961 (CTAs, highlights, elegance)
Light Gold:     #ddc497 (Hover states)
White:          #ffffff (Text on dark backgrounds)
Off-white:      #f8f9fa (Light section backgrounds)
```

**Rationale:** Dark navy and charcoal create a heavy, trustworthy atmosphere similar to premium consulting firms. Gold accents provide prestige and elegance without being flashy.

### Typography

```css
Primary Font:   'Noto Serif JP' - For Japanese text, prestigious feel
Secondary Font: 'Cormorant Garamond' - For English text, classical elegance
Sans-serif:     System fonts - For UI elements and forms
```

**Rationale:** Serif fonts convey tradition, expertise, and professionalism - essential for executive recruitment. The combination of Japanese and Western serif fonts creates a sophisticated, global aesthetic.

### Layout Structure

**Full-screen sections** with parallax backgrounds create cinematic impact:
- Hero: 100vh with centered content
- About: Grid layout (text + image) with parallax background
- Value: Card grid with hover animations
- Process: Vertical timeline with numbered steps
- Cases: Card grid with category badges
- Contact: Form + info sidebar with parallax background
