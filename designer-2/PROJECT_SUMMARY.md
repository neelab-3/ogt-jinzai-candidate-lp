## Design Decisions & Rationale

### Color Choice
**Decision:** Dark navy (#0A1628) as primary color
**Rationale:** Creates the heavyweight, trustworthy atmosphere required for executive recruitment. Darker than typical blue to convey premium positioning and seriousness.

### Typography
**Decision:** Noto Serif JP for headlines, Noto Sans JP for body
**Rationale:** Serif font creates prestigious, established feeling requested in requirements. Large scale (up to 88px) commands attention and creates impact. Sans-serif for body ensures optimal readability.

### Spacing
**Decision:** 8px base grid with generous spacing
**Rationale:** Modern minimalist approach requires breathing room. Generous spacing emphasizes quality and allows content to shine. Consistent grid creates visual harmony.

### Layout Approach
**Decision:** CSS Grid for most layouts, clean rectangular containers
**Rationale:** Grid provides precise control for geometric layouts. No rounded corners or decorative elements maintains minimalist aesthetic. Content-first approach puts emphasis on message.

### Animation Strategy
**Decision:** Subtle, purposeful animations only
**Rationale:** Animations should enhance understanding and guide attention, not distract. Smooth 60fps performance ensures professional feel. Intersection Observer ensures efficient resource usage.

### No Image Dependencies
**Decision:** Design works perfectly without images
**Rationale:** Ensures fast loading, no licensing issues, and complete scalability. CSS gradients and typography carry the design. Images can be added to enhance but aren't required.

### Accessibility First
**Decision:** WCAG AA compliance from start
**Rationale:** Inclusive design is ethical and expands reach. Proper semantic HTML and keyboard navigation ensure all users can access content. High contrast aids readability.

## Comparison: Designer-2 vs Designer-1

While both designs meet the requirements, Designer-2 emphasizes:

| Aspect | Designer-2 Approach |
|--------|---------------------|
| **Typography** | Bolder, larger scale (up to 88px) |
| **Spacing** | More generous negative space |
| **Layout** | Geometric, grid-based precision |
| **Decoration** | Minimal, content-first |
| **Contrast** | Higher contrast (navy/white) |
| **Animation** | Subtle, purposeful only |
| **Feel** | Modern tech, clean, bold |

Designer-1 might emphasize:
